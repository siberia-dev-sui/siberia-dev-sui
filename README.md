### 🐺 The Architect of Swarms

Senior Software Architect specializing in **High-Performance Liquidity Infrastructure** & **DeFi Protocols**.
I don't just write code; I orchestrate a multi-agent AI system called **The Swarm Court Protocol™**.

---

### 🏛️ How I Work (The Swarm Court Protocol™)
Every line of code I ship goes through a rigourous AI-Governed pipeline:
1.  **Governor Module:** Context injection via dynamic `.cursorrules` (Move/Rust/Solidity).
2.  **Spec-First:** Logic validation via Mermaid diagrams before coding.
3.  **The Swarm Court Review:**
    *   🛡️ **Security Judge:** Zero-tolerance for reentrancy/overflows.
    *   ⛽ **Gas Judge:** O(n) optimization for Sui/Solana efficiency.
    *   💥 **Chaos Judge:** Adversarial fuzzing to break the contract.

**Result:** Production-grade code delivered in 30% of the usual time.
