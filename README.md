### 🧠 The Evolution: Swarm Court V4.0 (Self-Aware Architecture)
My viral protocol (350k+ views on LinkedIn) has evolved. I don't just orchestrate agents; I engineer **Self-Aware Systems**.

Every line of code goes through this 4-Stage Pipeline:

#### 1. 🔮 Predictive Impact Analysis (The Elena Engine)
Before coding, the system consults its Vector Memory (RAG) to predict:
*   "If we change `User.model`, what breaks in the Payment API?"
*   **Result:** Zero unexpected breaking changes. 60% less refactoring.

#### 2. 🏛️ The Constitution (Dynamic Context)
Context isn't just pasted; it's enforced via cascading `.cursorrules` and architectural constraints derived from the project's history.

#### 3. ✅ AI-TDD (Test-Driven Intelligence)
Agents write the breaking tests *first*. Implementation only begins once the "Failure Scenario" is defined.

#### 4. ⚖️ The Swarm Court (Final Judgment)
Three specialized agents must vote `PASS` (5/5) to merge:
*   🛡️ **Security Judge:** Audits for Reentrancy, Access Control & OWASP vulnerabilities.
*   ⛽ **Gas/Performance Judge:** Optimizes O(n) complexity and Cloud costs.
*   💥 **Chaos Judge:** Performs adversarial attacks on the logic.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Arsenal
*   **Core:** Rust, Solidity, Move (Sui), Python (FastAPI).
*   **AI Orchestration:** LangChain, ChromaDB (RAG), Cursor/Windsurf.
*   **Infrastructure:** Docker, AWS, Terraform.
